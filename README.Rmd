# mpspline2

This package is a space to re-work `GSIF::mpspline()`, because the doco says it needs tidying up.

This is only set up as a package so I could use `testthat` and `roxygen2` easily. Also I don't understand SCM repositories, and don't really want to >.>

## Installation

Don't! Or use `devtools::install_github('obrl-soil/mpspline2)`, I'm not the boss of you.

## Outcome

Better:

  * Full unit testing coverage, for great confidence
  * Clearer documentation and commentary (or at least, more of it :P)
  * Handles multiple input formats - don't need to use SoilProfileCollection
  * TMSE in output object

Worse:

  * Not as fast :( 
  
???:

  * Refuses to predict 1cm values outside input data range (on purpose).
  * Refuses to deal with sites that have overlapping horizons (on purpose).
  * Default return object is different. 'Classic' option is available.
