# mpspline2

This package is a space to re-work GSIF::mpspline, because the doco says it needs tidying up, so hey, why not me?

Its probably not going to stay as a standalone package, I mostly just wanted access to testthat and also I don't understand SCM repos :P

## Installation

Don't! Or use `devtools::install_github('obrl-soil/mpspline2)`, I'm not the boss of you.
